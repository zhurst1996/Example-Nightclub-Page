                    <h4>Location</h4>
                    The saying goes that the three most important factors in real estate are "location, location and
                    location." The same concept holds true for nightclubs. Nightclubs work best in high-traffic
                    areas where customers can come in off the street and enjoy the venue's atmosphere. The best
                    locations also have enough parking, are easy for new customers to find, and have adequate floor
                    space, electrical connections and restroom facilities.

                    <h4>Concept</h4>
                    The concept of the nightclub is another vital attribute that contributes toward the venture's
                    success. Owners should develop a concept that has some staying power and caters to its target
                    audience, even in the face of the fads and trends. For instance, a high-end wine bar typically
                    would not do well in a working-class neighborhood, and a country-themed club would have a
                    difficult time establishing a clientele in an urban environment.

                    <h4>Promotion</h4>
                    Since many high-traffic occasions, such as New Year's Eve or the Super Bowl, occur only once a
                    year, nightclub owners must strive to attract customers every other day of the year. Nightclub
                    promotions on days when traffic is traditionally low can boost a business toward profitability.
                    Happy hour drink specials, trivia contests and karaoke machines give customers fun activities
                    during the week while providing the business with much-needed revenue on slow days.

                    <h4>Staff</h4>
                    Successful nightclub operations extend well beyond what a single owner can handle. Professional
                    bartenders, waitstaff, bar backs and security staff are essential to providing a smooth and
                    entertaining time for customers. Music venues rely on sound engineers and lighting technicians
                    to deliver a memorable visual and acoustic experience. Owners of music venues also must decide
                    if they want to feature live bands, DJs or dancers to give the customers the sounds and
                    atmosphere that they want.
